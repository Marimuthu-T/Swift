struct with non optional properties and not default values and initializer -will it throw error




Unlike stored instance properties, you must always give stored type properties a default value. This is because the type itself doesn’t have an initializer that can assign a value to a stored type property at initialization time.

Stored type properties are lazily initialized on their first access. They’re guaranteed to be initialized only once, even when accessed by multiple threads simultaneously, and they don’t need to be marked with the lazy modifier.
